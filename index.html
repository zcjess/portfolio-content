		<p>I am a UX designer who likes photography. I started photography since my sophomore year when I exchanged at Berkeley. My first camera was Sony A6000, and a year later, I switched to Sony A7R2.</p>

		<p>Photography cultivates me to be more detail-oriented and aesthetic. I also learned lots of photo editing skills during this journey. I recently learned how to replace skies which is super useful when the scenary is ruined by cloudy skies.</p>
