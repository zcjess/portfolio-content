	<p>These photos were taken near my school at illinois, which is located at the center of cornfields. However, its isolation from big cities also makes it close to the nature. We can drives to a beautiful park in 10-20 minutes.</p>

	<p>In summer 2019, we drove to an observatory to observe galaxy and shooting stars. What a good summertime memory!!!</p>
